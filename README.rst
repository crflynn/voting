Examples
--------

Apportioning seats using the Huntington-Hill method.

.. code-block:: python

    from voting import apportionment


    votes = [2560, 3315, 995, 5012]
    seats = 20
    assignments = apportionment.huntington_hill(votes, seats)


Calculating the effective number of parties using Golosov's measure.

.. code-block:: python

    from voting import diversity


    parties = [750, 150, 50, 50]
    effective_parties = diversity.golosov(parties)


Measuring the disproportionality of democratic representation using the
Sainte-Lague measure.

.. code-block:: python

    from voting import proportion


    votes = [750, 150, 50, 50]
    seats = [80, 16, 2, 2]
    disproportionality = proportion.sainte_lague(votes, seats)

Determining the Droop quota

.. code-block:: python

    from voting import quota


    votes = 1000
    seats = 20
    election_quota = quota.droop(votes, seats)
